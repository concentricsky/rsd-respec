        This document describes the Rich Skill Descriptor (RSD) class and how RSDs should be published for
        compatibility with services that process machine readable representations of skills and competencies. Each
        RSD is primarily identified by a canonical URL and consists of a skillStatement and supporting metadata to
        identify alignment to other skills or job categories.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In order to create a ecosystem of recognition around skills, where Achievements, Pathways, and Learner
          Records make machine-readable references to skills and allow systems to react to the skills learners hold,
          it is important for implementers to use skills in common ways. RSDs build on <a href="https://credreg.net/ctdlasn/handbook">CTDL-ASN</a>
          to enable skill definers to offer definitions that can be referenced from digital credentials (including those
          that appear in learner records), pathways, and job profiles.
        </p>

        <h3>Skill Statement</h3>
        <p>A skill statement is a string that expresses information about who the skill applies to, the nature of the skill itself,
          and the context in which it is applied, together, e.g.: "{Subject} {Predicate} {Context}". Consistent formatting assists
          interoperability of RSDs across organizations and the development of common usage of RSDs valued in common.

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
        RSDs operate within an ecosystem of interoperable Skills, Credentials, Pathways, and Learner Records. There are some key use cases that bring
        these ideas together to deliver impactful outcomes for learner-workers and organizations.
      </p>

      <h3>Align a Credential to RSDs</h3>
        <p>
          <em>
            As an issuer of credentials that recognize the achievement of skills, I would like to include a reference to one or more RSDs that a
            credential recognizes in the credential achievement description metadata.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are multiple approaches in different web standards communities for interoperable, portable, and verifiable digital credentials, but
          a common pattern is an assertion awarded to an individual who the issuer asserts has achieved a particular learning goal, whether that
          is a skill, learning objective, assessment, certification, or other criteria. In the below example, and Open Badges achievement definition
          is a BadgeClass with criteria that represents the assessment of an underlying RSD, which the credential aligns to. Note that the OB
          vocabulary term <code>targetName</code> is used alongside the canonical RSD term <code>skillName</code>.
