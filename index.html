        This document describes the Rich Skill Descriptor (RSD) class and how RSDs should be published for
        compatibility with services that process machine readable representations of skills and competencies. Each
        RSD is primarily identified by a canonical URL and consists of a skillStatement and supporting metadata to
        identify alignment to other skills or job categories.

        This document is a working draft of a standards implementation recommendation document produced by the <a
        href="https://openskillsnetwork.org">Open Skills Network</a> in order to advise membors and collaborators about
        available web standards and how to use them in a coordinated fashion to accomplish key use cases around the
        publication, recognition, and consumption of skills for learning and employment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        There is no conformance testing for implementers of these recommendations. Specific referenced standards often
        have their own normative requirements that are required for interoperability using those standards.
      </p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In order to create a ecosystem of recognition around skills, where Achievements, Pathways, and Learner
          Records make machine-readable references to skills and allow systems to react to the skills learners hold,
          it is important for implementers to use skills in common ways. RSDs build on <a href="https://credreg.net/ctdlasn/handbook">CTDL-ASN</a>
          to enable skill definers to offer definitions that can be referenced from digital credentials (including those
          that appear in learner records), pathways, and job profiles. Partners in an interoperable skills ecosystem
          may use CTDL/CTDL-ASN and/or other vocabularies and web standards to present skills descriptors and related
          concepts. This document provides the Open Skills Network's technical guidance on approaches for publishing
          and making use of this data, taking best advantage of available data standards.
        </p>

        <p>
          Below are a listing of data models that may be useful in building interoperable systems that work with skills,
          and use cases for specific procedures and capabilities desired for implementation. Examples and usage notes
          provide guidance for how these concepts should be understood and used.
        </p>

        <h2>Publish a Rich Skill Descriptor</h2>
        <p>
          <em>As an educational institution, I would like to publish a skill that is taught, assessed, and recognized
            by the organization in machine-readable interoperable format so that it can be referenced in other resources
            by the organization and employers</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          The concept of a single skill or competency, expressed with rich metadata and alignment, is the foundation of
          a skills vocabulary. Organizations or individuals in different roles in the skills ecosystem may find it
          useful to publish a skill definition. That includes employers, individual educators, educational institutions,
          industry consortia or professional associations, or collaborations between these different roles.
        </p>

        <p>Some of these publishers may at times describe the concept of a skill using different terminology, such as
          competency, learning outcome or standard, but what is shared between all of these models is the possibility
          for each skill to be associated with a canonical URL where it is made available and the ability to retrieve
          descriptive metadata that expresses the full meaning of the skill definition.
        </p>

           <h3>Skill Statement</h3>
           <p>A skill statement is a string that expresses information about who the skill applies to, the nature of the skill itself,
             and the context in which it is applied, together, e.g.: "{Subject} {Predicate} {Context}". Consistent formatting assists
             interoperability of RSDs across organizations and the development of common usage of RSDs valued in common.
           </p>

      <h2>Align a Credential to RSDs</h2>
        <p>
          <em>As an issuer of credentials that recognize the achievement of skills, I would like to include a reference
          to one or more RSDs that a credential recognizes in the credential achievement description metadata.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many contexts in which alignment is useful. Higher ed institutions would like to describe the skills
          recognized by a credential they issue. This serves the purpose of communicating to potential earners what
          skills are taught in curriculum, as well as communicating to the potential employers of learners who gain this
          credential what skills have been achieved. For most purposes of alignment, the achievement level of a skill is
          binary, rather than on a sliding scale. That means there is a threshold level of attainment that is required
          in order to award a credential that recognizes that skill, and this is the same basic level that is referenced
          in other objects that align to a skill, such as a job position description. There may be more advanced use
          cases for alignment of skills that indicate an achievement level of the skill that the credential recognizes
          that will be described separately.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are multiple approaches in different web standards communities for interoperable, portable, and
          verifiable digital credentials, but a common pattern is an assertion awarded to an individual who the issuer
          asserts has achieved a particular learning goal, whether that is a skill, learning objective, assessment,
          certification, or other criteria. In the below example, and Open Badges achievement definition is a BadgeClass
          with criteria that represents the assessment of an underlying RSD, which the credential aligns to. Note that
          the OB vocabulary term <code>targetName</code> is used alongside the canonical RSD term
          <code>skillName</code>.

       <p>
         There are additional vocabularies in use in the market to describe the concept of a Credential and the
         underlying skills or competencies to which it aligns. The following relationships in other standards SHOULD be
         considered the equivalent
       </p>

       <p>
         Other open vocabularies that allow for the description of a Credential (as an example of the concept of a
         Defined Achievement) use a so-called "three-object model" for alignment. In this model, a credential has one or
         more alignments that each describe the target partially, but the alignment descriptor object is a separate
         entity from the alignment target object. For the purposes of the interoperabiltiy of this alignment
         information, some three-object approaches SHOULD be considered equivalent to the Open Badges
         <code>alignment</code> usage in the example above.
